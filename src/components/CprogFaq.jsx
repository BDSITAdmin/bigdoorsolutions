            question: "Why is C called a mid-level programming language?",
            answer:
                "Due to its ability to support both low-level and high-level features, C is considered a middle-level language. It is both an assembly-level language, i.e. a low-level language, and a higher-level language. Programs that are written in C are converted into assembly code, and they support pointer arithmetic (low-level) while being machine-independent (high-level). Therefore, C is often referred to as a middle-level language.",

            question: "What are main characteristics of C language? ",
            answer:
                "C is a procedural language. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, simple set of keywords, and clean style. These features make it suitable for system programming like operating system or compiler development. ",
